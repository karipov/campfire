## What are these files?
All the source code is within the [`src`](https://github.com/karipov/campfire/tree/main/src) directory. The [`main`](https://github.com/karipov/campfire/blob/main/src/main.py) file contains the GPIO-checking loop and other files work on different aspects of the plant recognition, detection and narration pipeline. The [`campfire.service`] helps setup everything as a `systemd` service such that the device works on-boot.
